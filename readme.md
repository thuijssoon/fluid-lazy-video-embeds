### Welcome to our GitHub Repository

Embedding videos in your page can significantly enhance the user experience, but can also drastically slow down your page loading time or break the page flow. This plugin aims to solve both issues, by lazy loading your YouTube and Vimeo videos and making them fluent (responsive).

The plugin will wrap and amend your video embed output to display a video thumbnail with a recognizable play button on top. The video will only be loaded once the butten is pressed. In order to achieve this, the plugin will inject a stylesheet and javascript file.

## TODO ##

There are still various items on my todo list:

1. Add configuration settings
2. Make the plugin more developer friendly by adding more filters and actions
3. Ensure the code is fully commented
4. Create an option to load videos once they are in view (using [jQuery-Sonar](https://github.com/artzstudio/jQuery-Sonar) or similar plugin)
5. Maybe rewrite jQuery code in Vanilla JS
6. Make use of the YouTube and Vimeo APIs to get more video information (better thumbnails)
7. Add video SEO options
